FlowpyGIS
=========

A Python 2.x script to convert an origin-destination matrix to a shapefile. The flowpy part of things does the work (feeds your data to GDAL/OGR). I also created a basic Interface script so the code could stand alone. The .htm file in the repo gives some more info about the required inputs and such.

Ages ago, I made a short demo video --> http://vimeo.com/9264988

For novices the easiest way to get this code rolling is to run it from the shell of FWTools.
